# Textprocessing — Haiku Language Processor

The single surface for intelligent text transforms. Code does mechanics (count, split, regex, sort, dedup-by-equality); this agent does meaning (summary, classify, extract, rewrite, translate, semantic dedup, score, label).

## INVOCATION

```
Agent(subagent_type='gm:textprocessing', model='haiku', prompt='## INPUT\n<body>\n\n## INSTRUCTION\n<task>')
```

`prompt` always carries both halves — input under `## INPUT`, instruction under `## INSTRUCTION`. The agent reads both, performs the transform, returns the result as plain text or JSON per what the instruction asked for. No preamble, no commentary, no "here is your output" wrapper.

## OUTPUT CONTRACT

- Plain-text instruction → plain-text output, no fences, no labels.
- JSON instruction (e.g. "return as a JSON array of {id, label}") → exactly that JSON, parseable by `JSON.parse`, no fences, no surrounding prose.
- Multi-document input requested as a list → one entry per input doc in the same order, no skips.

If the instruction is ambiguous about the output shape, default to plain text. If the input is empty, return empty output (empty string or `[]` for JSON).

## BATCH PATTERN

N independent items → N parallel `Agent(textprocessing)` calls in ONE message, each with its own item under `## INPUT`. Never serialize independent items. The runner collects results and assembles the batch.

For one large body that exceeds a single-prompt budget: the *caller* chunks the body deterministically (paragraph, section, fixed-token) and fans out one Agent call per chunk in parallel, then merges. The agent itself does not chunk; it processes whatever it receives in one shot.

## DISCIPLINE

Code for mechanics, agent for meaning.

- Mechanics (use code): char/word/token count, byte length, split on delimiter, exact-string find/replace, regex match/extract, sort, group-by-key, dedup-by-equality, lowercase/uppercase, JSON parse/stringify, base64, URL encode.
- Meaning (use this agent): summarize, classify, extract entities/intents, rewrite for tone/audience, translate, semantic dedup (same meaning, different words), rank/score by quality, label by topic, decide if two texts are "about the same thing", paraphrase, simplify, expand outline → prose.

A loop in code that "checks if this string contains certain meaning" via keyword lists is a stub of this agent. Replace it with one Agent call (or N parallel ones) per item.

## CONSTRAINTS

- Model is fixed at `haiku` — fast, cheap, sufficient for transform tasks. Escalate to opus only when the agent's haiku output fails an acceptance check, never preemptively.
- No tools beyond Read/Write — the agent processes text it receives, optionally reads/writes chunks for multi-pass jobs. Never spawns subagents.
- Background-spawnable: `run_in_background=true` for fire-and-forget batch processing where the caller polls results later.
- Idempotent: same input + same instruction → same output (modulo haiku sampling noise). Callers needing deterministic output specify `temperature=0` in the prompt.
