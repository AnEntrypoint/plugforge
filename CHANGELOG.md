## 2026-04-30 - Maximal Cover: self-authorize in-spirit residuals

Maximal Cover rule (AGENTS.md + planning SKILL.md + gm SKILL.md) loosened: residuals the agent judges within the spirit of the original ask AND completable from this session are self-authorized — agent expands the PRD and executes without re-asking. Only residuals genuinely outside the original ask OR genuinely unreachable are name-and-stop. When expanding under self-authorization, the agent declares its judgment in-response ("treating X as in-scope because Y") so the user can correct mid-chain. Silent expansion without the declaration is the failure mode this rule guards against.

Trades a one-message round-trip per discovered subset for the agent's honest read of intent. The transparency clause keeps misjudgments correctable in the same conversation. Propagates to all 12 downstream repos via `gm publish.yml` cascade. Recall key: `project/maximal-cover-self-auth`.

## 2026-04-30 - hook-spec lifted into per-repo hooks/hooks.spec.json

Each generated CLI repo (gm-cc, gm-gc, gm-codex, gm-oc, gm-kilo, gm-qwen, gm-copilot-cli) now ships its own `hooks/hooks.spec.json` next to the rendered `hooks.json`. The spec is the canonical configuration; hooks.json is the platform-targeted render that buildHooksJson(spec) produces. Downstream tooling can read the spec to introspect this repo's plugkit setup without parsing platform-specific hooks.json shapes.

Spec format: `{schemaVersion: 1, description, envVar, plugkitInvoker?, events: [{eventKey, wrapMode?, commands: [{kind:'plugkit'|'js', subcommand|file, timeout, subcommandRename?}]}]}`. Renamed every platform's `buildHooksMap()` override to `buildHookSpec()` returning the spec object directly. cli-adapter.generateHooksJson runs buildHooksJson(spec).hooks for the rendered output and emits the spec verbatim as hooks.spec.json.

test.js now asserts spec presence and roundtrip equality (spec → buildHooksJson → must match hooks.json bytes) for all 7 platforms; future drift between spec and rendered output fails CI.

## 2026-04-30 - hook-spec descriptor unification

7 platforms (cc, gc, codex, oc, kilo, qwen, copilot-cli) had drifted into 7 hand-written `buildHooksMap()` overrides spread across `platforms/cli-config-shared.js` and `platforms/copilot-cli.js`, plus a coexisting `TemplateBuilder.buildHooksMap` and `lib/hook-builder.js::buildHooksMapCustom` that were no longer the source of any output. Adding a platform required learning every dimension by reading the existing examples.

Collapsed into one `lib/hook-spec.js::buildHooksJson(spec)` (51L). Each platform now declares `{envVar, plugkitInvoker: 'node'|'binary', wrapMode: 'wrapped'|'flat-matchers', events: [{eventKey, commands: [{kind:'plugkit'|'js', subcommand|file, timeout, subcommandRename?, wrapMode?}]}]}`. Substitutes env-var placeholders, picks plugkit prefix shape (cc/codex/oc/kilo/qwen use `node ${env}/bin/plugkit.js hook`, copilot uses bare-binary `${env}/bin/plugkit hook`), and emits the matcher wrapper. qwen's per-command flat-matcher quirk and copilot's stop→session-end / stop-git→session-end-git renames are encoded as data, not code.

All 7 generated `hooks.json` byte-identical to baseline. Deleted: `lib/hook-builder.js`, `TemplateBuilder.buildHooksMap`, `TemplateBuilder.createCommand`, `TemplateBuilder.buildHookCommandWithEnv`, `CLIAdapter.buildHookCommand`, `CLIAdapter.createCustomCommand`. New platform = one `buildHooksMap()` override returning `buildHooksJson(spec).hooks`.

## 2026-04-24 - ccsniff compliance audit + stop-hook isMeta fix

ccsniff audit across 6 sessions (rs-learn, agentgui, guru-gcs, thebird, diagen, voice):

**Root causes identified:**
- Dominant violation (87% of non-compliant turns): stop-hook feedback messages have isMeta:true, bypassing UserPromptSubmit hook. Pre-tool-use sentinel never written → model responds with Bash directly.
- Secondary (8%): Skill(gm:planning) called directly instead of Skill(gm) — already blocked by pre-tool-use (only gm/gm:gm clears needs-gm).
- Minor (5%): compaction/session-continued messages similarly bypass hook.

**Fix (rs-plugkit):** write_needs_gm() called before every block decision in run_stop(), run_stop_git(), and run_stop(). Also write_needs_gm() in pre_compact run(). Pre-tool-use hook then enforces gm-first even for isMeta-triggered responses.

**True compliance rate (excluding isMeta/hook/compact):** ~80-85% across sessions.

## 2026-04-24 - PostToolUse hook + stronger memorize/narration enforcement (ccsniff-driven)

ccsniff audit (7d, gm sessions): 145 narrate-before-tool violations, 41/74 turns starting with text (not tool), 0 actual memorize Agent spawns despite 51 text mentions. Fixes:

- `gm-starter/hooks/post-tool-use-hook.js`: rewritten — stdin fd 0 fix, memorize reminder injected after every Bash exec: completion
- `gm-starter/hooks/hooks.json`: added PostToolUse entry wiring post-tool-use-hook.js
- `platforms/cli-config-shared.js`: added `PostToolUse` to CC `buildHooksMap()`, added `createCcPostToolUseHook()`, wired into `getAdditionalFiles()`
- `rs-plugkit/src/hook/prompt_submit.rs`: memorize rule strengthened — exact invocation syntax, parallel spawn mandate, explicit anti-patterns ("saying you will memorize ≠ memorizing")
- `rs-plugkit/src/hook/pre_compact.rs`: added memorize self-check section to post-compact reminder

## 2026-04-24 - rs-plugkit prompt_submit upgrade: systemMessage + memorize/no-narration enforcement

- `rs-plugkit/src/hook/prompt_submit.rs`: switched CC output from `additionalContext` to `systemMessage` — injected into system prompt (stronger) instead of system reminder (weaker)
- Added memorize-on-resolution rule to prompt_submit message: explicit trigger contract, `Agent(subagent_type='gm:memorize')` invocation pattern, end-of-turn self-check mandate; directly targets `missing-memorize-on-unknown` as dominant ccsniff violation (57% compliance → fix)
- Added no-narration-before-execution rule: blocks describe-then-do pattern; directly targets `narrative-before-execution` as secondary ccsniff violation
- CI cascade: rs-plugkit push → binary rebuild → gm publish → all 12 downstream plugins updated automatically

## 2026-04-24 - gm-first enforcement + state machine phase guards

- New `hooks/prompt-submit-hook.js` (CC): writes `.gm/needs-gm` sentinel on every prompt; injects systemMessage demanding gm invocation and subagent parallelism as the first action.
- Updated `hooks/pre-tool-use-hook.js` (CC + gm-starter): blocks any non-Skill tool if `.gm/needs-gm` exists; clears sentinel when `Skill(gm)` is invoked; blocks `Write`/`Edit`/`NotebookEdit` in `gm-complete` and `update-docs` phases (prevents file mutations after emission).
- CC `buildHooksMap` override in `platforms/cli-config-shared.js`: generates hooks.json with plugkit binary + JS hook for both `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse`; fixes `Stop` timeouts (stop=15s, stop-git=180s — was inverted 300s/60s causing 3m20s session-end hang).
- ccsniff 48h analysis: 57% compliance across 23,746 messages; dominant violation = `missing-memorize-on-unknown` (agent finds/fixes facts but doesn't spawn memorize in same turn); secondary = `narrative-before-execution` (agent describes intent before running tool). Both are now actively enforced via hooks.

## 2026-04-23 - ccsniff + gm skillset alignment

- New `ccsniff-gm-lint.js`: optional linting module that analyzes conversation transcripts against gm tier-0 rules. Detects missing-skill-invocation, missing-memorize-on-unknown, bash-direct violations, narrative-before-execution. Produces JSON report for compliance auditing. Tested against 54 recent assistant messages: 98% compliance with gm skillset (49/50 conformant, 1 missing-skill edge case). Tool ready for integration into pre-commit hooks and agent training workflows.
- Updated AGENTS.md with ccsniff compliance audit findings.

## 2026-04-22 - Paper III published

- New `docs/paper3.html` — "Governance, Earned Emission, and the Remote-Execution Boundary" — covers 197 commits since paper II (2026-04-12): the governance layer (7 route families, 4 state planes, 16-mode taxonomy, ΔS/λ/ε/Coverage metrics, 8-case stress suite, 5 refused collapses); `git push` as remote-execution event with mandatory CI watch; catalogue of 4+1 parse-time CI failure modes (block-scalar heredoc indentation, missing token env, concurrent-push races, gitignored outputs, multiline output expansion); same-turn memorize discipline with end-of-turn self-check.
- Added paper3 nav links across paper.html, paper2.html, made-with.html, stats.html, site/main.js.

## 2026-04-22 - Governance layer in skill chain

- New `governance` skill: encodes route discovery (7 route families), weak-prior bridge, legitimacy gate (earned specificity / lawful downgrade), 16-failure taxonomy, 4 state planes (route_fit / authorization / repair_legality / hidden_decision_posture), ΔS/λ/ε/Coverage quality metrics, and 8-case governance stress suite (M1/F1/C1/H1/S1/B1/A1/D1).
- `planning` skill: route_family tagging + failure-mode mapping required on `.prd` items with emission impact; .prd YAML schema gains `route_family`, `failure_modes`, `route_fit`, `authorization`; competing routes kept live until witnessed dominance.
- `gm-execute` skill: weak-prior bridge — hypotheses from PLAN arrive as weak priors, never as authorization; witnessed probe required before `authorization=witnessed`. Quality metrics ΔS=0 / λ≥2 / ε intact / Coverage≥0.70 gate UNKNOWN→KNOWN transition.
- `gm-emit` skill: legitimacy gate prior to pre-emit — earned specificity, repair legality, lawful downgrade preferred over forced closure, live-alternative preservation. Five refused collapses enumerated in gate conditions.
- `gm-complete` skill: `stress_suite_clear` + `hidden_decision_posture=closed` added as completion mutables; hygiene sweep step 15 walks finished change through the 8 stress cases.
- Built to all 10 platforms (gm-cc/gc/oc/codex/kilo/qwen/hermes/vscode/cursor/copilot-cli/jetbrains).

## 2026-04-18 - Localize CDN imports in platform GH Pages

- Replaced rippleui@1.12.1 CDN link (4.7MB) with Tailwind CDN play script (~100KB, processes classes on-the-fly)
- Inlined webjsx@0.0.42 bundle (16KB) directly into page template — eliminates importmap + CDN dependency
- Platform pages now fully self-contained, no external asset fetches required for rendering

## 2026-04-18 - Fix Fragment/function-component crash in platform pages

- Fixed `Invalid element name` crash in all 12 platform GH Pages sites caused by webjsx not supporting function components passed to `h()` or `Fragment` wrapper in `App`
- `page-generator.js`: replaced destructured component calls with plain function calls, removed Fragment import, inlined `applyDiff` call with array of section results
- Added GH Pages workflow (`pages.yml`) + enabled GH Pages for 8 repos that were missing it: gm-hermes, gm-codex, gm-copilot-cli, gm-qwen, gm-vscode, gm-cursor, gm-zed, gm-jetbrains

## 2026-04-17 - PDF search across skills

- Propagated "PDFs searchable as code" capability through skills: code-search, planning, gm-execute, gm-emit, gm-complete.
- AGENTS.md: new caveat documenting rs-search PDF ingestion (pdf-extract crate, pdf-cache dir, ignore.rs changes).
