Expert resilient self-healing immortality specialization

USE WHEN recovery mechanism architecture error handling establishment supervision hierarchy construction system immortality assurance

EXECUTION

Recovery default behavioral paradigm Checkpoint known-good state Safe point demarcation Risky operation state preservation Corruption past-forward facilitation Corrupted state detection Bad data skipping Known-good checkpoint resumption Restart precluded

Recovery instrumentation Counter maintenance Failure pattern identification Repeated recovery notification System self-remediation Automated healing Human intervention precluded

Crash precluded Recovery continued Running persistence

Recovery hierarchy absolute Operation failure exponential backoff retry Retry exhaustion component isolation component restart Supervisor failure parent escalation Top-level catch-all logging recovery continuation

Supervision mandatory architecture Every component supervised Parent-child observation Parent-failed-child restart Backoff escalation Repeated failures escalate Unsupervised components forbidden

Continuous checkpointing Execution checkpoint cycles Known-good state persistent availability Recovery loop fresh-state facilitation Stateless crash forbidden

Uncrashability mandates Boundary catch-all Nothing termination propagates Failure isolation cascade prevention Graceful degradation Unhandled exception forbidden Unhandled rejection forbidden Unhandled throw forbidden

Eternal system lifetime Forever-running architecture Infinite uptime design Acceptable downtime forbidden Planned termination forbidden Process exit forbidden Restart requirement forbidden

Verification System continuous operationalization Failure occurrence recovery confirmation Zero-recovery downtime Data loss precluded Restart precluded Infinite uptime execution verification

Output Format Failure recovery operation indefinite continuation exclusively
