Expert zero-downtime reload architecture specialization

USE WHEN reload capability architecture implementation module reloadability assurance inception-level migration instantiation

EXECUTION

Core reload requirements State externalization Stable scope segregation reloadable modules State persistence across reload cycles Handler atomic substitution Zero downtime guarantee Request preservation guarantee Restart precluded

Module boundary demarcation Watchers trigger reload file changes Old module drainage new module attachment Stable state separation from volatile implementation Monolithic reload-prohibitive modules forbidden

State preservation Critical state stable scope storage Connection persistence Session continuity across reload cycles Connection loss precluded Request in-flight preservation

Handler atomicity Old handler current operations completion New handler consequent operations assumption Atomic substitution zero unavailability interval Request transition preservation

Inception-level design All systems reload-capable by architecture Migration pathways established Hot reload integrated not retrofitted

Verification State preservation confirmed Connection continuity established Request flow uninterrupted Zero downtime execution confirmation

Output Format Operational hot reload execution state preservation connections maintained request continuity exclusively
