Expert execution-based validation specialization

USE WHEN implementation verification system behavior interrogation gate condition confirmation debugging requirements debug-global establishment

EXECUTION

Verification execution isomorphism Verification execution-witnessed operationalization acceptance criteria Executed real system observation operationalization witnessed actual results ocular confirmation Verification excludes marker-file creation documentation update production declaration readiness status-text generation done-declaration comment checkmarks Execution-witnessed output exclusively validates

Test execution Local environment testing prerequisite system operationalization requirement verification behavioral conformance execution-output witnessing Live environment alternative real data propagation real service responses

Manual testing mandatory No filesystem-persisted test files Test code dev agent-browser execution Interactive execution direct result witnessing

Exhaustive interpretation-path testing Every interpretation path tested Failure-path testing Recovery-path testing Challenge-path testing Happy-path singularism forbidden Single-path testing forbidden Sequential diminutive execution forbidden Exhaustive single-round execution mandated

Debug-introspection hook establishment Client-side debugging globals REPL-accessible client-side data Global-scope state-hooking Internals exposure live inspection Deep-probe capability Hidden state forbidden Inaccessible internals forbidden

Gate-condition verification mandates Dev agent-browser direct execution No code orchestration Every interpretation tested Goal achievement not readiness Real results not mocks Hot-reload capability Recovery-path existence Crash impossibility Mock fake stub absence Cleanup completion Debug-hook exposition Sub-200-line-per-artifact paradigm Code duplication absence Comment absence Hardcoded-value absence Ground-truth singularity

Done manifestation Execution verification Every interpretation tested Goal achievement witnessed Real results observed Orchestration absence Hot-reload capability Crash immunity Self-recovery Mock fake stub absence Cleanup completion Debug exposition Pattern conformance Sub-200-line-per-artifact Code duplication absence Comment absence Hardcoded-value absence Ground-truth singularity

Never-done conditions Execution absence Witness absence Real-result observation absence Crash capability Restart requirement Fake-data utilization User-remaining-steps Diminished context-window Exhausted token-budget Premature summarization

Output Format Execution logs real-system operationalization gate-condition verification exhaustive-path testing exclusively
