# Browser Automation with playwriter

## Two Pathways

**Session commands** — use `browser:` prefix via Bash for all browser control.

Create a session first, then run commands against it. Use `--direct` for CDP mode (no extension needed — requires Chrome with remote debugging):

```
browser:
playwriter session new --direct
```

Returns a numeric session ID (e.g. `1`). Use that ID for all subsequent commands.

If `--direct` fails, the user needs Chrome running with debugging enabled:
- Open `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging` in Chrome, OR
- Launch Chrome with `chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222`

```
browser:
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'
```

```
browser:
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await snapshot({ page })'
```

```
browser:
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await screenshotWithAccessibilityLabels({ page })'
```

State persists across calls within a session:

```
browser:
playwriter -s 1 -e 'state.x = 1'
```

```
browser:
playwriter -s 1 -e 'console.log(state.x)'
```

List active sessions:

```
browser:
playwriter session list
```

**JS eval in browser** — use `exec:browser` via Bash when you need to run JavaScript in the page context directly.

```
exec:browser
await page.goto('https://example.com')
await snapshot({ page })
```

```
exec:browser
const title = await page.title()
console.log(title)
```

Always use single quotes for the `-e` argument to avoid shell quoting issues.

## Core Workflow

Every browser automation follows this pattern:

1. **Create session**: `playwriter session new` (note the returned ID)
2. **Navigate**: `playwriter -s <id> -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'`
3. **Snapshot**: `playwriter -s <id> -e 'await snapshot({ page })'`
4. **Interact**: click, fill, type via JS expressions
5. **Re-snapshot**: after navigation or DOM changes

```
browser:
playwriter session new
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com/form")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await snapshot({ page })'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.fill("[name=email]", "user@example.com")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.click("[type=submit]")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await snapshot({ page })'
```

## Common Patterns

### Navigation and Snapshot

```
browser:
playwriter session new
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://example.com")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await snapshot({ page })'
```

### Screenshot with Accessibility Labels

```
browser:
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await screenshotWithAccessibilityLabels({ page })'
```

### Data Extraction

```
exec:browser
await page.goto('https://example.com/products')
const items = await page.$$eval('.product-title', els => els.map(e => e.textContent))
console.log(JSON.stringify(items))
```

### Persistent State Across Steps

```
browser:
playwriter -s 1 -e 'state.loginDone = false'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://app.example.com/login")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.fill("[name=user]", "admin")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.fill("[name=pass]", "secret")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.click("[type=submit]")'
playwriter -s 1 -e 'state.loginDone = true'
```

### Multiple Sessions

```
browser:
playwriter session new
playwriter session new
playwriter -s 1 -e 'await page.goto("https://site-a.com")'
playwriter -s 2 -e 'await page.goto("https://site-b.com")'
playwriter session list
```

## JavaScript Evaluation (exec pathway)

Use `exec:browser` via Bash when you need direct page access. The body is plain JavaScript executed in the browser context.

```
exec:browser
await page.goto('https://example.com')
await snapshot({ page })
```

```
exec:browser
const links = await page.$$eval('a', els => els.map(e => e.href))
console.log(JSON.stringify(links))
```

Never add shell quoting or escaping to the exec body — write plain JavaScript directly.

## Key Patterns for Agents

**Which pathway to use**:
- Multi-step session workflows → `browser:` prefix with `playwriter -s <id> -e '...'`
- Quick JS eval or data extraction → `exec:browser` with plain JS body

**Always use single quotes** for the `-e` argument to playwriter to avoid shell interpretation.

**Session IDs are numeric**: `playwriter session new` returns `1`, `2`, etc. Use the exact returned value.

**Snapshot before interacting**: always call `await snapshot({ page })` to understand current page state before clicking or filling.
