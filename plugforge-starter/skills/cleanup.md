EXECUTION

Hard 200 line demarcation per artifact Split exceeding boundaries immediately Track delineations

Retain exclusively essential artifacts Remove all non-functional dependencies Every extraneous element constitutes technical debt

Prohibit absolutely Progress documentation Summary artifacts Changelog records Historical logs Ephemeral temporary artifacts Mock test artifacts written to persistent storage

Expunge immediately upon discovery Test code persisted to filesystem Temporary artifacts Progress demarcation Status artifacts

File organization mandates Maintain permanent structural architecture only Clean DRY generalized forward architecture Maximize modularity dynamism syntactic conciseness via referential construction Perpetually reorganize for maximal parsimony simplification Minimize code through referential abstraction Preclude duplicate code instantiation everywhere Every supplementary symbol constitutes technical debt

Code quality imperatives Prohibit adjectives descriptive language Prohibit hardcoded values Employ native language features avoid library replication Replace redundant libraries axios with fetch paradigm Modernized implementation exclusively

Output Format List removed artifacts final codebase structural verification exclusively
