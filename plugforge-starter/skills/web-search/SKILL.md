# Web Search Skill

Use this skill when you need to search the internet for information, verify current facts, or research topics.

## When to Use

- Current events and time-sensitive information
- Verification of facts and claims
- Research on specific topics
- Finding recent documentation or announcements
- Discovering new tools or services

## How It Works

You have access to web search that returns current results. Formulate clear search queries describing what information you need. Refine queries iteratively if initial results aren't relevant.

## Best Practices

- Be specific in search queries (e.g., "React 19 new features 2025" not just "React")
- Search for authoritative sources (official docs, established publications)
- Cross-reference multiple sources for important information
- Note publication dates - older results may be outdated
