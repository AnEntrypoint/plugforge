# Code Search Skill

Use this skill when you need to explore code, find patterns, or understand how features are implemented.

## When to Use

- Understanding unfamiliar codebases
- Finding where specific functionality is implemented
- Discovering naming patterns and conventions
- Locating related code across files
- Learning how existing features work

## How It Works

Semantic code search uses embeddings to find relevant code by meaning rather than exact syntax. Describe what you're looking for in natural language.

## Search Examples

Instead of: "find lodash imports"
Try: "Where are utility functions imported from external packages?"

Instead of: "find error handling"
Try: "How does the code handle and report failures?"

## Best Practices

- Describe intent, not syntax (code search understands meaning)
- Start broad, refine if results too wide
- Look at imports and exports to understand dependencies
- Check multiple files to see patterns
