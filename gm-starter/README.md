# glootius maximus (gm)

> **more coushin' for the puhin'**

gm is a claude code plugin that convinces your coding agent it already is a deterministic state machine — PLAN → EXECUTE → EMIT → VERIFY → COMPLETE — and then enforces that conviction with rust-backed hooks, witnessed execution, and a covering family of bounded subsets that refuses to let "follow-up" become a synonym for "I gave up."

it is named after **glootius maximus**, the muscle that holds you in the chair while you finish the work. the name is the joke and the discipline at once: the agent that sits down through PLAN → EXECUTE → EMIT → VERIFY → COMPLETE actually ships. the agent that stands up early ships a stub with a green check on it.

built over ~200 commits of daily use. free, open source, maintained by one person.

disclaimer: this is extremely opinionated. it will block bash, redirect your tools, refuse to write test files, force you to push git before ending a session, and reject any execute call without an explicit timeout. if that sounds terrible, this is not for you. if that sounds like what you wish your agent did automatically, keep sitting down.

## install

```
claude plugin marketplace add AnEntrypoint/gm
claude plugin install -s user gm@gm
```

update:
```
claude plugin marketplace update gm
claude plugin update gm@gm
```

or set up an alias so you stop forgetting:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && echo -e '#!/bin/sh\nclaude plugin marketplace update gm' > ~/.local/bin/gmupdate && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/gmupdate && echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

it should just work. if you want to make sure the subagent always engages, add "gm everything" to your prompt. the gm agent is injected at session start and reinforced on every prompt submit, but explicitly calling it does help.

**note:** all tools use bun x for fast startup and automatic npm caching. mcp-thorns, codebasesearch, and mcp-gm run via bun x with no version suffix so bun's local module store is reused between sessions — adding `@latest` forces a registry round-trip every cold start. refresh manually with `bun pm cache rm` when you actually want a newer release. you need bun installed: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`

## what it does

### gm agent

the core. a system prompt delivered as a state machine, organized into 7 charters:

1. **prd** - task planning with .prd file enforcement. every task gets a dependency graph with parallel execution waves. the stop hook blocks session end when .prd items remain. this is the single biggest behavior change - the agent cannot declare "done" and walk away with work remaining.

2. **execution environment** - all code runs through the Bash tool. every hypothesis proven by execution before changing files. tool redirects enforce this: find is blocked, glob is blocked. exploration goes through code-search.

3. **ground truth** - no mocks, no fakes, no unit tests, no test files on disk. real services, real api responses only. when the agent discovers mocks in your codebase it will delete them and implement real paths. this is the most controversial charter.

4. **system architecture** - hot reload, crash-proof, recovery hierarchies, async containment, debug hooks. every system the agent builds must survive forever by design.

5. **code quality** - 200 line file limit, no comments in code, no duplication, convention over code, buildless, dynamic systems, preemptive modularity.

6. **gate conditions** - quality gate before any file modification. all conditions must pass simultaneously: executed, tested, witnessed, hot reloadable, crash-proof, no mocks, under 200 lines, no hardcoded values.

7. **completion verification** - witnessed execution is the only proof. not marker files, not documentation updates, not saying "done." the agent must execute the system end to end and observe actual behavior.

the charter system was rewritten on feb 12 using concepts from WFGY research - 33 flat sections reorganized into 7 scoped charters with a constraints block. 44% token savings while preserving all 82 behavioral concepts.

### tools

**code-search** (codebasesearch) - dependency-free semantic vector search. describe intent in plain language, not regex syntax. "find authentication validation" locates auth checks, guards, permission logic - however they're implemented.

**thorns** (mcp-thorns) - one-shot AST analysis at conversation start. compact codebase overview: structure, flow, orphans, hubs, repetitions. eliminates the first 5-10 turns of manual exploration.

### hooks

**session-start** - injects gm agent context, runs thorns AST analysis, adds code-search documentation. sets up the entire session.

**prompt-submit** - reminds the agent to use gm subagent for everything. reinforcement on every turn.

**pre-tool-use** - blocks find and glob in favor of code-search. blocks .md file creation (except AGENTS.md and README). blocks scattered test file creation (.test.js, .spec.ts, __tests__/, fixtures/, mocks/) — only root `test.js` is permitted.

**stop (.gm/prd.yml)** - checks `.gm/prd.yml`. if items remain, blocks session end. this is the looping mechanism - more refined than wiggum looping, includes native planning behaviors with better tooling preferences and a revision loop.

**stop (git)** - checks for uncommitted changes and unpushed commits. blocks session end until everything is pushed. make sure you have a git remote set up.

### browser access

for client-side coding and browser automation, the recommended approach is playwriter:
https://github.com/remorses/playwriter

note: playwriter uses a browser plugin - grab and activate that too to get browser access. gm references `agent-browser` skill throughout the charter system for browser integration.

## gm build system

this plugin is built by gm, a build system that generates 10 platform implementations from a single source directory:

- 6 CLI platforms: claude code, gemini cli, opencode, kilocode, codex, github copilot cli
- 4 IDE extensions: vs code, cursor, zed, jetbrains

one source in gm-starter/ (gm.json, agents/, hooks/) propagates to all 10 outputs. adding a hook or changing the agent automatically appears everywhere. github actions handles publishing to all 10 downstream repos on every commit via the rust binary cascade pipeline.

repo: https://github.com/AnEntrypoint/gm

## test.js policy

gm enforces a single `test.js` at project root. no jest, no mocha, no scattered `.test.js` files. one file, 200 lines max, plain node assertions. the agent creates it if absent, updates it with every behavior change, and adds regression cases for every bug fix. `gm-complete` runs it before allowing session end — failure regresses to EXECUTE.

this replaces all unit testing. the rationale: unit tests with mocks diverge from production behavior. one integration test against the real system catches what matters.

## .gm/ directory

all gm metadata lives in `.gm/` at project root (auto-gitignored by postinstall):

- `.gm/prd.yml` — active work items (task tracking)
- `.gm/lastskill` — last invoked skill (restored after context compaction)

`test.js` stays at project root — it's user-facing, not metadata.

## architecture clarifications

**gm is a build system, not a monorepo of plugins.** the `gm` repo contains a single source (`gm-starter/`) and a builder (`cli.js`) that generates 10 platform-specific outputs. the downstream repos (`gm-cc`, `gm-gc`, `gm-oc`, etc.) are build artifacts published by CI — not independent projects. there is nothing to consolidate.

**state enforcement is programmatic, not advisory.** the skill chain (`planning` → `gm-execute` → `gm-emit` → `gm-complete` → `update-docs`) is invoked via hooks at session start and prompt submit. the `.prd` file is the state tracker — the stop hook reads it and blocks session end while items remain. tool-use hooks block writes before planning completes. this is not "claude voluntarily following markdown."

**validation exists.** `validate/probe.js` runs 14 scenarios against hook scripts across platforms. `lib/strict-validator.js` validates build output structure. the project does not use test files by design — the validation harness tests hook behavior end-to-end against real inputs.

**security enforcement is hook-based.** `pre-tool-use-hook.js` blocks dangerous tool patterns (find, glob, test file creation, unauthorized .md writes). the rust plugkit binary (`rs-plugkit`) enforces command blocklists at the binary level. hooks fail loud — silent degradation is a bug, not a feature.

**naming is frozen.** the project is "gm" (glootius maximus). previous names are archived. all redirects point here.

## what doesn't work yet

- hot reload is architecture-ready but not fully implemented in the plugin itself
- the ground truth charter is aggressive and will delete your test suites if you're not expecting it
- thorns can timeout on very large codebases
- the gemini and opencode adapters are functional but less battle-tested than claude code
- ide extensions (vscode, cursor, zed, jetbrains) don't have hooks yet - only cli platforms do
