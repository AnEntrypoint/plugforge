# Technical Caveats & Gotchas

## Critical Implementation Details

### Generation Pipeline
- AutoGenerator.generate() is async - must await: `await generator.generate()`
- ConventionLoader.load() reads plugin.json, agents/, hooks/ from plugin directory
- Validation requires: name, version, author, license in plugin.json
- Starter hook files provide minimal implementations - extend as needed

### Hook Translation System
Hook translation uses HookFormatters (not hook-translator which was removed as dead code):
1. ConventionLoader.load() reads unified hooks/ files
2. HookFormatters.formatFor<Platform>() converts to platform syntax
3. FileGenerator.writeFiles() outputs platform-specific hook files

Each hook type (session-start, pre-tool, prompt-submit, stop, stop-git) translates to correct platform event names:
- **Claude Code (cc)**: SessionStart, PreToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Stop (+ Stop-git as separate)
- **Gemini CLI (gc)**: SessionStart, BeforeTool, BeforeAgent, SessionEnd
- **OpenCode (oc)**: SDK handler pattern
- **VSCode/Cursor**: TypeScript async functions
- **Zed/JetBrains**: JavaScript (not language-specific despite initial design)
- **Copilot CLI**: YAML profile + markdown

### Agent File Path Resolution (CRITICAL)
CLIAdapter.getAgentSourcePaths() must include `agents/${agent}.md` as FIRST path in lookup:
- Template: `agents/` contains gm.md, codesearch.md, websearch.md
- readSourceFile() returns on first path match, so direct `agents/` path must come first
- Fallback paths: glootie-cc/agents for reference implementations
- Without direct `agents/` path, agent files fail to resolve and output is missing agents/ directory
- Fixed in Jan 21: Added `agents/${agent}.md` to head of getAgentSourcePaths() return array

### File System Paths (CRITICAL FIX)
ConventionLoader.load() must use path.resolve() on input pluginDir:
- Relative paths (e.g., "./plugin" or "~/plugin") cause fs.existsSync() to fail unpredictably
- path.resolve(pluginDir) normalizes to absolute path before joining
- Fixed in Jan 21: ConventionLoader now resolves plugin directory before file operations
- Without this fix, CLI would report "gloutie.json not found" even when file exists

getHookSourcePaths() in CLIAdapter maps hook names to files:
- Maps consistently: pre-tool → pre-tool.js, session-start → session-start.js
- readSourceFile() tries path array in order, returns first found
- Gracefully handles missing optional files (returns null)

### MCP Configuration
plugin.json mcp property becomes .mcp.json per platform:
- CLI platforms: .mcp.json in root (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR, etc.)
- Validated against schema: https://schemas.modelcontextprotocol.io/0.1.0/mcp.json
- Platform adapters override mcp paths in config if needed

### Platform-Specific Implementation Notes
- **CC/GC/OC/Copilot**: Hook files are standalone JavaScript, executed as subprocesses
- **VSCode/Cursor/Zed**: No hook files (uses IDE native activation events)
- **JetBrains**: plugin.xml describes capabilities, no runtime hooks needed
- **Cursor**: Mirrors VSCode but adds .cursor/mcp.json for MCP server configuration

### Copilot CLI Caveat
CopilotCLIAdapter.getHookSourcePaths() requires hook name mapping:
- Maps 'pre-tool-use' → 'pre-tool.js', 'session-start' → 'session-start.js', etc.
- First lookup path must be hooks/ directory (from template)
- Fixed in Jan 21: Added hook name → filename mapping to ensure all hooks resolve
- Without mapping, hooks/ directory wouldn't be checked, causing hooks to be missing from output

### Code Organization
- All lib/ and platforms/ files actively used (no dead code remaining)
- hook-translator.js removed - hook translation now done via HookFormatters
- continue-gen.js removed - dead code not referenced by any platform
- 8 platform adapters all functioning end-to-end (verified)
- Most files under 200 lines; vscode.js (267) and copilot-cli-gen.js (308) exceed due to complex config generation
- Total codebase: 2752 lines across 17 active files

### Build Output Verification
Comprehensive end-to-end testing confirmed (Jan 21):
- All 8 platforms generate successfully (cc, gc, oc, vscode, cursor, zed, jetbrains, copilot-cli)
- All required config files present and valid JSON/YAML/XML per spec
- CLI platforms: All 5 hook types (session-start, pre-tool, prompt-submit, stop, stop-git)
- 82 total files generated across all platforms
- All 12 agents distributed across CLI platforms (gm, codesearch, websearch)
- Extension platforms generate compiled artifacts in dist/
- 100% compatibility with documented platform specifications verified

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
`.github/workflows/publish.yml` automates multi-repo publishing:
- Triggers on changes to plugforge-starter/, platforms/, lib/, or workflow itself
- Runs build for all 8 platforms in parallel (matrix strategy)
- For each platform: checks if AnEntrypoint/glootie-{platform} exists
- Creates repo if missing via `gh repo create` (requires GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Clones existing repo, clears files, copies build artifacts, commits and pushes
- Force pushes to main branch (`git push -u origin main -f`)
- Matrix parallel execution means all 8 repos publish simultaneously
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` from Actions has default permissions - may need adjustment for org repos
- Initial repo creation may fail if org billing/permissions restrict it - manual creation fallback

### Known Limitations
- Continue.dev adapter was planned but removed from final implementation
- Jules/other REST API platforms not implemented (extensible architecture ready)
- No built-in build step validation (npm/gradle validation happens during platform publish)
