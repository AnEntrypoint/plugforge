# Cursor Agent Rules

Follow these patterns for Cursor IDE integrations.

## Tool Usage
- Use cursor.extensions.* APIs for integration
- Register hooks in extension manifest
- Activate on workbench ready

## Agent Pattern
- Load agents from agents/
- Initialize on startup

## Semantic Code Search

Your editor uses **semantic code search** to understand your intent, not just syntax patterns.

### How It Works
- **Intent-based**: Describe what you're looking for in plain language
  - "Find authentication validation" → locates auth checks, guards, permission logic
  - "Where is database initialization?" → finds connection setup, migrations, schemas
  - "Show error handling patterns" → discovers try/catch patterns, error boundaries

- **NOT syntax-based**: Unlike regex patterns, semantic search understands meaning across files
- **Cross-file understanding**: Finds related code patterns regardless of implementation details

### When to Use Code Search
- Exploring unfamiliar codebases
- Finding similar patterns you've seen before
- Understanding how components integrate
- Locating where features are implemented
- Discovering related code sections
