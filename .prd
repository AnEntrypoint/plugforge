# Plugforge Kerned Framework PRD

## Work Items

- [x] Merge all 10 skills into single agents/gm.md (DONE: No per-invocation skill cost)
- [x] Delete separate skill files (DONE: skills/ directory removed entirely)
- [x] Rewrite gm.md with unambiguous expressive language (DONE: 2131 words, clear and explicit)
- [x] Remove all punctuation except where semantically required (DONE: unpunctuated paragraphs)
- [x] Document all complexity into CLAUDE.md with corner cases (DONE: Kerned framework section)
- [x] Create kerned framework design to prevent runtime surprises (DONE: 30+ corner cases documented)
- [x] Ensure buildless turnkey zero config setup verified (DONE: Build succeeds for all 9 platforms)
- [ ] Verify hot reload capability in real execution
- [ ] Verify crash recovery in real execution
- [ ] Validate plugin:gm:dev execution works
- [ ] Validate plugin:browser:execute workflows
- [ ] Remove dead code identified by thorns (auto-healer.js orphaned)
- [ ] Consolidate template-builder patterns duplication (thorns identified 5x)
- [ ] Reduce cli-config-* files duplication (5x copy-paste pattern)
- [ ] Reduce base.js vs copilot-cli-gen.js duplication (5x common code)
- [ ] Verify no test files exist (unit testing forbidden)

## Completed This Session

1. Merged 10 individual skill files into agents/gm.md
2. Eliminated per-invocation cost by removing separate skill directories
3. Made all language explicit unambiguous through comprehensive clarity review
4. Addressed all 60+ clarity issues identified by fresh perspective agent
5. Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md kerned framework documentation
6. Documented all corner cases and contingencies
7. Removed all punctuation except where semantically required
8. Verified build succeeds for all 9 platforms without skills/
9. Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect skills consolidation
10. Confirmed conventions-driven discovery working

## Architecture Changes

- Before skills/ directory with 10 separate SKILL.md files
- After agents/gm.md single unified agent with all behavioral rules
- Eliminates agent startup overhead and per-invocation skill costs
- Each merged skill section substantial enough to justify consolidation
