## Stop Hook .prd-rename Bug Fix

### Investigation Phase
- [ ] Locate stop hook code (stop-hook.js, stop-hook-git.js)
- [ ] Search for `.prd-rename` references across codebase
- [ ] Understand why .prd-rename is being written instead of .prd
- [ ] Check git history for recent changes to stop hook
- [ ] Identify root cause: accidental rename, wrong variable, file path logic

### Root Cause Analysis
- [ ] Why does .prd-rename exist in code?
- [ ] Is it a typo or intentional transformation?
- [ ] Where does the rename logic come from?
- [ ] Does it affect git staging or file operations?
- [ ] What files reference this behavior?

### Fix Implementation
- [ ] Correct the file path from .prd-rename to .prd in stop-hook.js
- [ ] Correct any related paths in stop-hook-git.js
- [ ] Remove .prd-rename references from codebase
- [ ] Verify no other files use .prd-rename
- [ ] Test that hook writes correct .prd file

### Verification
- [ ] Execute stop hook in plugin:gm:dev
- [ ] Confirm .prd file is created with correct name
- [ ] Confirm .prd-rename is NOT created
- [ ] Verify hook can read the .prd file correctly
- [ ] Test end-to-end: create items in .prd, run stop hook, verify output

### Cleanup
- [ ] Remove any .prd-rename files that were created
- [ ] Ensure no test artifacts remain
- [ ] Verify git status is clean
