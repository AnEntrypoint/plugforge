# Plugforge Improvements - Apply gmweb Lessons

## Issues to Fix

### 1. GitHub Actions Sync Issues
- [ ] Verify deleted files from plugforge-starter are cleared from target repos
  - Current: workflow uses `git clean -fdx` before copying files
  - Issue: May not catch all cases, need explicit file deletion tracking
  - Fix: Add rsync with --delete flag or explicit deletion list

### 2. Generic Template Distribution  
- [ ] Ensure generic files (README, LICENSE, package.json boilerplate) sync to all repos
  - Current: Only platform-specific adapters generate files
  - Issue: Generic templates may not propagate to all 9 repos consistently
  - Fix: Create generic template layer distributed by all adapters

### 3. CLAUDE.md Documentation
- [ ] Restructure CLAUDE.md - condense mundane, expand architecture
  - Current: Good structure but can be more concise per gmweb pattern
  - Configuration Reference section too verbose
  - Technical Caveats could be more condensed (issue/fix format)

### 4. Build Verification
- [ ] Add validation that generated files match expected manifest
  - Report orphaned files (in output but not expected)
  - Report missing files (expected but not in output)

## Verification Needed

- [ ] Check if `git clean -fdx` truly removes all deleted files from target repos
- [ ] Verify all 9 repos receive identical generic template files
- [ ] Confirm adapter file generation is consistent across platforms
