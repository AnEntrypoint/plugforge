- [x] Remove dead code identified by thorns (auto-healer.js orphaned)
- [x] Consolidate template-builder patterns duplication (thorns identified 5x)
- [x] Reduce cli-config-* files duplication (5x copy-paste pattern) - REMOVED 4 re-export files, consolidated to cli-config-shared.js
- [x] Reduce base.js vs copilot-cli-gen.js duplication (verified: not duplicates - different architectural patterns)
- [x] Verify no test files exist (unit testing forbidden) - VERIFIED: no .test.js, .spec.js, test/, __tests__/, fixtures/, mocks/ found
- [x] Validate plugin:gm:dev execution works - VERIFIED: all Node.js capabilities operational
